## About
This project aims to build a Cafe Searching App using SwiftUI. Available features include Cafe lists by location, Trending Cafe lists, and User Profile with save places feature. 

Attempted to follow design heuristics and iOS Human Guidelines by 
* keeping minimalistic and aesthetic visuals
* using familiar functions and views
* using icons instead of text only
* allowing user controls with saved place feature
* allowing simple gestures like tapping
